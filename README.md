Hi I have Created a Zerodha clone project using HTML and CSS which involved attending lectures to understand the concepts of HTML AND CSS, also as part of a challenge organized by the members of the <CodeShack Summer of Code(CSOC) under the CodeShack_community. The project aimed to replicate the interface of Zerodha, a popular Indian financial services company, focusing on practicing and enhancing frontend development skills. Throughout the lectures, I learned how to structure a webpage using HTML and style it effectively using CSS. This challenge not only helped in understanding web development fundamentals but also encouraged me to know my basic fundamentals of Web Development using HTML and CSS.
